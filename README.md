# Last.fm Search

A way to search for artists on last.fm for when you really don't want to use last.fm's website.s

Created using create-react-app & my brain.

## Local Development

Run `npm start` in the terminal to run the app locally.

Run `npm test` to run tests.

## If I Had More Time...

- Use the concept of styled components for the few cusom Material UI styles I have
- Pagination on search
